    'text1' => 'Silk is a soft and durable fabric with a pleasant glossy sheen. The thread manufacturing technology is unique - it is obtained by unwinding miniature silkworm cocoons. The secret of making silk has long been known only in China. Despite the fact that now the noble fabric is made in India, Brazil and other countries of the world, China to this day remains the largest producer of silk.
        This fabric is used for sewing clothes, home textiles, underwear, upholstery and bedding sets.
        There are different types of silk fabrics depending on the quality of the thread and the weaving.',
    'title1' => 'Atlas',
    'text2' => 'Smooth fabric, which got its Arabic name for its delicate, shiny texture - the material was invented in China, and it got to Europe through Arab countries. Atlas is easy to distinguish among silk fabrics by its elegant appearance. The intertwined threads form a vertical pattern because the warp overlaps five or more horizontal weft threads. The weave of the fabric is called satin.

    'title2' => 'Gas',
    'text3' => 'The transparent and weightless fabric was named after the Middle Eastern city of Gaza. The interlacing of the threads is special - two threads of the warp are connected to one weft and are not compacted. There is space between the threads that allows the gas to be so light.
Properties:',

    'title3' => 'Crepe',
    'text4' => 'Crepe fabric is rough and grainy to the touch. The effect is achieved thanks to a special multidirectional twist of the threads. A meter thread can be twisted about a thousand times. Crepe silk is very resilient, dense and incredibly durable.
Features of the fabric:',

    'text5' => 'Airy, lightweight fabric, yet tough enough to securely hold the shape of the product. It is believed that the first organza samples came to Europe from Uzbekistan. The weightless texture of the fabric is achieved by tightly twisting fine silk threads.
Advantages:',
    'l14' => 'does not wrinkle;',
    'l15' => 'retains its shape and does not shrink;',
    'l16' => 'transmits light;',
    'l17' => 'durability;',
    'title5' => 'Satin',
    'text6' => 'A smooth, shiny material that resembles satin and is considered a more affordable variation. The weave pattern of the same name is horizontal, that is, a large number of weft threads bend around and hide the warp threads.
Satin is available in bleached, printed and monochrome. A very beautiful variety is jacquard (fabric with a large braided pattern that resembles embroidery).
Material properties:',
