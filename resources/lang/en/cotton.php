    "text1" => 'The most widespread and inexpensive plant fiber in the world to manufacture is cotton. The plant began to be cultivated several thousand years ago in America; later, cotton began to be grown in China and India. On the territory of the former USSR, cotton fields were concentrated in Uzbekistan.
    	The fabric is made from fibers (cotton wool) that are formed inside the cotton seed boll. Depending on the length and thickness of the fiber, the yarn is short-staple, fine-staple and medium-staple.
        Cotton fiber is 95% cellulose, the rest is an admixture of minerals and fats.
        Natural cotton fabric has the following positive qualities:',
    'li1' => 'absorbs moisture, increasing its own strength; ',
    'li2' => 'due to the hollow fiber, cotton retains the heat coming from the body; ',
    'li3' => 'successfully competes with silk in strength; ',
    'li4' => 'does not cause allergies; ',
    'li5' => 'has the property of shrinkage of the washing field; ',
    'li6' => 'lends itself well to ironing; ',
    'li7' => 'cotton is the cheapest natural fabric.',
    'text2' => 'The disadvantages include: poor resistance to decay, loss of strength when exposed to high temperatures and fragility in wear. Eliminate these disadvantages by adding synthetic threads in the manufacture of fabric.
        Nowadays, all-natural cotton fabric is not as common as it used to be. The addition of synthetics multiplies the wear resistance and appearance (it is less wrinkled) of the fabric.
        Note: if you set fire to a piece of natural cotton, it will burn without residue, exuding the smell of burning paper.
        Cotton fabrics:',
    'li8' => 'denim (coarse twill weave made of thick threads);',
    'li9' => 'bike, flannel, bumazeya (dense material with fleece on one or both sides);',
    'li10' => 'coarse calico (thin, very dense matter);',
    'li11' => 'chintz, calico (thin, but dense and inexpensive fabrics, widely used for the production of bed linen);',
    'li12' => 'cretonne, tights, satin (dense and durable, but thin fabrics); ',
    'li13' => 'guipure, tulle, muslin (finest patterned materials);',
    'li14' => 'taffeta, poplin, percale (elegant fine fabric, plain weaving); ',
    'li15' => 'cambric (thin, but durable material, pleasant to the body); ',
    'li16' => 'marquise (similar in tenderness to cambric, but superior in strength).',
    'text3' => 'To give additional strength, a nylon thread is woven into the cotton fabric. Such material is used for sewing workwear. In addition to nylon, artificial fibers are added to cotton threads: viscose, polyester, acetate.
        Natural cotton is especially appreciated in the production of bedding and underwear, handkerchiefs and towels. Due to its hygroscopicity and softness, the cotton fabric is comfortable and pleasant for the body. It does not cause allergies and prickly heat in children. Chintz, cambric, marquise, calico, calico, flannel are used for sewing.
        In order for a thing made of natural fabric to serve for a long time and retain its appearance, you must adhere to simple rules.',
    'li17' => 'Machine wash temperature for coarse cotton fabrics - 60-90 degrees. For painted items, the water temperature is limited to 60 degrees. Organic solvents (vinegar, alcohol) are used to remove stubborn dirt. Jeans are washed at 40 degrees, avoiding spinning at high speeds. Thin fabrics (cambric, tulle) are washed by hand to avoid damage. The water temperature is 30-40 degrees.',
    'li18' => 'Do not dry natural cotton items in the sun. It is necessary to straighten out all the folds in the fabric as much as possible. Overdried items are difficult to iron.',
    'li19' => 'Iron the material slightly damp, or through a wet cloth. The heating of the iron is average. To prevent the fabric from stretching, the iron is passed along the material along, and not across.',
